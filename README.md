# Getting Started

## Using PHP

We recommend using the [PDF Generator SDK](https://github.com/gatenbysanderson/pdf-generator-sdk) to consume this API. For Laravel projects, we've created a [Laravel package](https://github.com/gatenbysanderson/laravel-pdf-generator) that wraps around the SDK for Laravel-specific requirements, such as compiling and parsing Blade templates before conversion.

Alternatively, use [GuzzleHTTP](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/) and make a POST request to the appropriate API endpoint as described below.
